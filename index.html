            <p style="font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 25px;margin-right: 15em;">The Lakers now stand at 2-1 losing thier debut agaisnt the neighboring Clippers. Lebron finished off with 18 points, 8 assists and 10 rebounds. While Lebron managed to still pull a double-double, nearly a triple double performance many were still not at ease with his production. After only one game, many critics were quick to crown Kawhi Leonard as the NBA's new king. In this article, I'll be discussing the first three games of Kawhi and Lebron. If you're interested in seeing what the stats have to say about LeBron and Kawhi, stay tuned. This is about to get good.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 25px;margin-right: 15em;">We won't go back to far with the stats, but let's just talk about Lebron's last season where he was plaqued with a persistent groin injury. He played 55 games last year over a 82 game season. Which isn't too bad, but it weighed heavy on the Lakers, when trying to compete for a playoff spot. But because James didn't play a minimum of 58 games, he wasn't able to qualify for the NBA League Leaders, his stats were glorified as much as Stephen Curry or Joel Embiid who averages were in the same ball park as James' and help the 4 and 5 spots for PPG(points per game). James is known for her numerous playoff runs with considerable weaker teams. Now the surprising part comes... James finished off the season with 27.3 ppg, 8.5 rpg and 8.3 apg. He would've been top 5 in the league's M.V.P., race had he played 58 games. James hasn't dropped below 25 ppg since his league entance, according to <a class="link" href="https://www.basketball-reference.com/">Basketball Reference</a>.

            <img align ="center" src="http://serenity.ist.rit.edu/~cjl4945/105/project1/assets/media/5db3144cdee0192b1b63d871.jpeg" alt="Kawhi Leonard">
            <p style="text-align: left;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 25px; margin-right: 15em;">
                Kawhi Leonard dominated the 2019 NBA playoffs. He carried Toronto’s offense and hit the greatest shot in franchise history to vanquish the 76ers, and then he locked up Giannis Antetokounmpo to push the Raptors past the Bucks. For an encore, he averaged 28.5 points, 9.8 rebounds, 4.2 assists, and 3.2 stocks per game in the Finals—often while moving around on ailing wheels—to sound the death knell for the Warriors’ dynasty, delivering Toronto’s first NBA championship and earning his second Finals MVP trophy.</p>

                <p style="text-align: left;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 25px;margin-right: 15em;">By the end of the postseason, Leonard had made a compelling case that he was the best basketball player in the world. Those who’d argue for another candidate, though, could point to one blemish on his resume: As great as he’d become as a defensive destroyer and an isolation-scoring monster, he still wasn’t quite on the level of a LeBron James or Kevin Durant because he hadn’t yet become a top-shelf playmaker.</p>

        <h1>Lebron vs. Kawhi</h1>
            
            <img align ="center" src="http://serenity.ist.rit.edu/~cjl4945/105/project1/assets/media/f2bc835d-685e-453a-a2f6-5bfa0d2940f6-large16x9_CavaliersSpursBaske_King.jpg">
            <p style="text-align: left;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 25px;margin-right: 15em;">The two superstars have met twice in the NBA Finals — with each winning a title and a Finals MVP against the other — but a host of factors have intervened. When James’s Miami Heat faced the San Antonio Spurs in the 2013 and 2014 Finals, Tim Duncan was still his headlining foil. In the years since, James has battled Kevin Durant for the title of the NBA’s best player and has been judged endlessly against Michael Jordan as the greatest of all time. Leonard, meanwhile, was a certified all-NBA talent but often an afterthought because of his injuries and five straight years without a head-to-head playoff showdown.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 25px;margin-right: 15em;">The Los Angeles Clippers’ 112-102 victory over the crosstown Lakers at Staples Center on Tuesday made it clear that the James vs. Leonard rivalry is suddenly unavoidable. During an intense opening night that saw Leonard showered with cheers and boos during introductions, the contest’s twin centerpieces traded highlights while standing in direct opposition in so many ways.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: left;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 25px;margin-right: 15em;">Both players execute their crafts in ways that draw every eyeball in the building. Playing in his first NBA game since March, James burst out of the gate with pent-up excitement. He scored the game’s first points on a reverse layup, quickly set up a Danny Green three and then splashed a turnaround jumper over Leonard after a few rocking dribbles. The Lakers charged to a 13-2 lead, and all the accumulated drama from six straight lottery trips seemed to evaporate.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: left;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 25px;margin-right: 15em;">The one-on-one battle for Los Angeles — and the Western Conference at large — is on, too. James provided the voice-over for a hype video that played up the Lakers’ history of dominance and popularity, while Leonard appeared in a Los Angeles-themed New Balance commercial that included him holding a crown key chain and a provocative closing tagline: “This is his city.” The Clippers played up their differences with the Lakers all night, beginning with a hype video that included phrasing such as “streetlights over spotlights” and “grit over glam.”</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: left;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 25px;margin-right: 15em;">“It’s the first game,” James said. “The NBA is back, and everybody is trying to have the narrative of a rivalry game and a huge test. Both teams are not who they want to be. We have a lot of room to improve. We’re a new group, a new coaching staff and a new system. It’s not a rivalry.”</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 25px;margin-right: 15em;">Oh, but it is.</p>
            
            <p style="text-align: left;font-family: Verdana,sans-serif; font-size: 25px;margin-right: 15em;">Let's leave this for some food for thought. Leonard finished the game with 30 points, 5 assists and 6 rebounds. James finished with 18 points, 8 assists and 10 rebounds. For anyone watching the game, you clearly see that Leonard was more focused on winning his battle in the "rivalry." While it seemed that James was trying assessing his teammate and test their abilites. The first game wasn't a clear determinate of the more dominant player, especially since James' capables have been proven even with biologically clock ticking.</p>
